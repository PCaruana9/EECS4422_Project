Hi! Thank you for participating.

To run, double click mcsvSaliency.exe. A console window will appear and it will ask you to input a 3 digit id. This can be any 3 digit number you like.

Once you press enter, a black window will appear. This experiment involves using your mouse to look at a series of blurred images. Your mouse will allow you to see a the image clearly.

There is no trick, or anything hidden - I just need you to look around at the images. Please try to just look around  You will have 7 seconds per image.

When you are ready, press any button to begin. This will show the image. When 7 seconds is up, the next image will load -> Press any button again to continue.
Do this over etc. until you have finished. 

When you are done your results are in TestResults folder. Please send the contents of this folder to me. Thanks :)
